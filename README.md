# Brain tumor detection

Brain tumor detection is a ai-based project made using CNN models with tensorflow .

## Problem statement

Brain is an organ that controls activities of all the parts of the body. Recognition of automated brain tumor in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a difficult task due to complexity of size and location variability. In this research statistical analysis morphological and thresholding techniques are proposed to process the images obtained by MRI for Tumor Detection from Brain MRI Images. Convolutional neural network will be used to classify the performance of tumors part of the image. The results produced by this approach will increase the accuracy and reduce the number of iterations.

##  CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.
